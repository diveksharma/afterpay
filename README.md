# Swipe-Select

## Intro
Hey! This component is built with React.js and Tailwind. 

It's a modern, reusable React component. This component is called swipe-select because you can swipe left-to-right and you can select one of several options in a fun and interactive way. Thank you for taking your time to checkout my code!
